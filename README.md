# Welcome to my dotfiles repo

This is the prime place to use my config files.

### Nvim

My neovim config files are in a folder called "nvim".
In there, there will be two folders, titled "config" and "local".
Inside the config folder, there will be two folders called nvim and coc.
Please place these folders in your `~/.config` folder.
To avoid plugin installation issues, the local folder has it preinstalled for you.
All you have to do is follow the next instructions.

## Local

This one might take a little effort. First, inside the local folder, there will be 2 other folders, share and state.
Inside each will be various files and folders. Please copy them to their respective location, `~/.local/state` or `~/.local/share`. Please don't overwrite the original folder, copy the individual files. You might erase some of your own other config files. Once done, reload nvim.

You're done!
